# Responsive Modals

> Modals are just a fancy word for pop-up. That's what this project is about. A minimal pop-up :)

This is a very simple one-page responsive project featuring three buttons that reveal a pop-up on click.

## Quick Start

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
* Clone the repo

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/airykka/Responsive-Modal.git
  ```
* Then enter the folder ```Responsive-Modal```

    ```shell
  cd Responsive-Modal
  ```

* Then open the ```index.html``` file in your web browser on your local machine.

* ...and that's it! You can now click on any of the buttons to reveal the modal.
